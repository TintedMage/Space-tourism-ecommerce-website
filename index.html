            Space tourism is human space travel for recreational purposes. There are several different types of space tourism, including orbital,
            suborbital and lunar space tourism.
            During the period from 2001 to 2009, seven space tourists made eight space flights
            aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft to the International Space Station, brokered by
            Space Adventures in conjunction with Roscosmos and RSC Energia.
            The publicized price was in the range of US$20â€“25 million per trip. 
            Some space tourists have signed contracts with third parties to conduct 
            certain research activities while in orbit. By 2007, space tourism was
            thought to be one of the earliest markets that would emerge for commercial spaceflight.
